# Controller assessment contract

Feature 014 requires assessment `reason_code` and any `resume_action` to match `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`: lowercase letters and digits separated by single hyphens, without spaces or underscores. Prompts that may emit these fields state the grammar, and the controller rejects malformed values before routing. (S021)

A `complete` envelope omits `next_step_id`, `gate_step_id`, and `resume_action`. A `continue` envelope contains only `next_step_id` targeting the declared loop body; a `blocked` envelope contains only a stable `resume_action`. Clean findings cannot justify an invalid envelope. Live verification records the rejection, corrects ambiguous source guidance, and retries refreshed source before claiming success. (S021)

Required operator input uses `blocked` with the exact question and resumption action. Shared paths remain permissible only when completed evidence determines downstream authorization; collapsed routing cannot collapse exact human choices or allow unverified success. Legacy `needs-human` remains compatibility for explicitly declared gates. (S021)

Authoring agents perform core-command self-checks, prerequisites, and quality checklists. These do not replace independent Reviewer or Code Reviewer assessment: authors cannot act as their own independent reviewers. This distinction changes no workflow nodes or review scope; Specify linkage and roadmap checks remain distinct. (S021)

The plan distinguishes read-only baseline/final checks from correction capacity; each workflow requires specific prior-finding or task resolution before another pass. Exact entry modes and limits are recorded in the [workflow loop reference](./workflow-loop-baselines-and-limits.md). (S022)

Close Out supplies each ingestion child the exact source-backed correction checklist alongside its unchanged single source argument. The checklist identifies the specific missing or stale claim to correct; independent assessment credits verified prior-claim resolution while retaining outstanding findings, rather than treating whole-source coverage as the progress unit. (S021)

Empty switch branches rejoin the next declared step, but a join grants no downstream authorization without completed evidence. Close Out’s newly approved verification and trustworthy existing verification paths join shared wiki maintenance; blocked or unapproved paths cannot acquire verified status through that join. Graph responsibilities remain explicit in the [workflow boundary reference](./workflow-graph-responsibility-boundaries.md). (S023)
