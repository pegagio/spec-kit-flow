# Workflow lifecycle

## Earlier source contracts

The following records retain earlier source intent; the accepted Feature 014 refinements below govern the revised workflow design. (S021)

An operator prepares a constitution and approved roadmap, establishes cited wiki context, chooses an eligible feature, and invokes each workflow deliberately. The documented route is start-feature, optional clarify, plan, tasks, analyze-remediate, implement, converge, and closeout. (S002)

Feature 013 used reviewed concrete step-model assignments for bounded Codex subagents. Updated Feature 015 source uses reviewed per-step native agent names instead. Human questions and review gates stay in the main task; completing one workflow does not authorize a later phase. (S002, S019)

Verified Feature 013 keeps the eight workflow phases separate while providing desktop-task execution with a main controller and step subagents; it does not add automatic chaining to the next phase. Direct controller skills use the FlowKit catalog route alongside the Specify bundle. (S018)

Verified Feature 015 assigns a reviewed native Codex agent name to each delegated step. Its supported desktop path shows the intended name in a task label and verifies native selection separately; model and effort appear when Codex exposes them. (S018)

Planning and task generation are separate. Clarification may need another session after the current five-question command limit. Analyze follows task generation or consequential artifact reconciliation; converge follows implementation until identified gaps are resolved. (S002)

Workflows preserve a manual-prompt fallback. Closeout requires a separately approved feature-completion operation and does not create one; completing a workflow does not merge or accept a feature. (S002)

Starting a feature requires unique roadmap eligibility, satisfied dependencies, an exact approved patch, and cited governing context. Partial or missing context blocks a speculative start. (S006)

The five-question clarification cap ends a session, not the ambiguity review; the operator explicitly chooses another session, planning readiness, or deferral. (S007)

Read-only analysis precedes any artifact remediation, and routine corrections return through dependent artifacts before another analysis. Consequential findings stop for a separate decision. (S010)

Closeout requires a separately approved completion operation, an exact roadmap verification patch approved by the operator, curated wiki maintenance, and a separate commit-readiness decision. (S013)

## Feature 014 approved scope

Feature 014's approved scope separates read-only candidate/dependency discussion and exact human selection/activation from same-target specification authoring. Selection updates only approved roadmap state and the active pointer; specification authoring is separately invoked. It also adds independent wiki maintenance while retaining separate planning and task generation. (S018)

**Accepted supersession**: S002 documents the earlier combined start-feature route; S018 now specifies separate Select Feature and Specify workflows and a stop-only deprecated combined source. This is a prospective F014 replacement, not a rewrite of verified earlier feature history. (S002, S018, S021)

## Feature 014 phase boundaries

Feature 014 requires separate Select Feature and Specify invocations before optional Clarify, Plan, Tasks, Analyze and Remediate, Implement, Converge, and Close Out. Wiki Lint Update is separately selected for wiki maintenance and needs no active feature. No successful phase silently starts another. (S021)

Clarify assesses residual ambiguity after each operator-answered bounded session. Plan and Tasks verify populated outputs and retry exact gaps; Implement repeats existing eligible work while progress is evidenced. Routine required input becomes blocked with a preserved question and resumption action. (S021)
