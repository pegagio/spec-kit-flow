# Project authority and review gates

Spec Kit Flow owns generic workflow definitions, approved reusable presets, portable consumer feedback capture and reporting, and maintainer-only feedback intake. Reviewed source packages are the authority for changes; installed copies in a consumer project are not. (S001, S003)

The operator controls workflow invocation and task scope. Every explicitly delegated step names a reviewed Codex agent, and the controller may launch bounded children using those names. Completing one workflow does not launch a later phase or imply roadmap verification, Git integration, feature acceptance, or Diagram acceptance. (S001)

Feature 013's earlier concrete-model arrangement allowed a named-step override. Feature 015's current assignment rule supersedes that approach: invocation authorizes the workflow's reviewed agent names without a per-run agent, model, or effort override, and a missing or unavailable assignment stops without fallback. (S001, S019, S020)

Feature 015's reviewed-agent constitution amendment was approved before workflow or controller source changes. Every delegated step names its own agent, and invocation provides no per-run agent, model, or effort override. (S020)

The controller keeps clarification questions and consequential gates in the main task and relays an answer to the same step subagent when continuation is needed. (S017)

Roadmap patches, constitutional amendments, material scope or authority changes, ambiguous recovery, Git integration, and acceptance retain explicit human gates. Routine remediation may flow back through the smallest relevant spec, plan, or task artifact within the operator-issued controller scope. (S001, S002)

Local validation should record tested CLI versions, component IDs, source coordinates, digests, and observed results. Bundle installation or native dispatch with a no-op Codex executable does not establish live-agent behavior, stock Spec Kit compatibility, publication, or consumer adoption. (S001, S002)

## Feature 014 routine and consequential decisions

F014 permits only declared, bounded core-command correction and reassessment inside the operator-selected workflow and scope. Exact roadmap patches, constitutional or authority changes, material scope, ambiguous recovery, substantive product answers, Git integration, and acceptance remain explicit operator decisions. Routine classification needs no redundant confirmation gate. (S021)

Required input is a blocked reason with the exact question and recovery action. Equivalent outcome keys may share a path only when completed evidence still checks every downstream prerequisite; a shared transition never infers approval. Legacy needs-human remains controller compatibility for declared human gates. (S021)
