# Export Workflow Feedback Report

Export consumer-local observations through this public syntax:

```text
speckit.flow-feedback.report --journal <JOURNAL_JSONL> --json <REPORT_JSON> --markdown <REPORT_MD> --producer <PRODUCER_REF> --created-at <RFC3339> --report-id <REPORT_ID>
```

The command validates every observation again, creates a self-contained report with a deterministic integrity digest, and writes a Markdown projection from that same report. It is offline and never uploads, submits, installs, changes, or triages anything. Transfer the two generated files through an explicit human-approved handoff to the Spec Kit Flow maintainer intake.
